Editor Features:

MOF File:
 Import mofs from mm3d.

GUI Editor:
 - Finish Map Editor

User interface improvements, including:
 - Grid editor should allow selecting multiple squares (maybe hold control to select more than 1?), and allow mass grid flag editing.
 - Make editors easier to use.

Look into that stupid MWD saving bug. Why does it work on 1.8.0_111, 1.8.0_144, 1.8.0_172, and 1.8.0_181, but not 1.8.0_161, or 1.8.0_201? The broken ones appear to use less RAM, and have spikes when viewing the map.
Eventually have some method which can allocate space into an executable at a given space so we could for instance add a new level into the level selector. This would need to modify pointers.

Eventually:
 - Stop hardcoding things we can avoid, from file names to ids. For instance, replace the automatic ISLAND.MAP remap with an option that lets you select a remap to apply. Could be supplied, could be user-made. Would also allow things like exporting the remap from the demo, and applying the remap to the PC release.
 - On major release, profile loading files, saving files, using map editors. There are occasional viewer spikes after adding 3d models to the view, and in the MOF view, when looking at animations, every so often one frame will be extra long due to a GC.

 Issues:
  - VRAM Editor kinda stinks. It would be nice to try and create a system to generate this automatically, or maybe show boundaries of other texture banks.
  - PP20 compressor is not very efficient. Could we make an algorithm that is as good as the original one?
  - Entities need some kind of height offset in the map viewer.
  - PSX VLO Save support.
